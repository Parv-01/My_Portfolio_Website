Problem 1 :-
First initiliased node using :-  npm initi -y
Then downloaded all the libraries i want 

Then used git to upload version system over the github but faced the problem of uploading node_modules also 
Then tried to add node_modules/ in .gitignore but as we already committed and make it in stage area we didnt get the required output 

HEnce we used git rm -r --cached node_modules to delete and make this query unstage and then push to  the main branch which make it a local folder not online one 

Problem 2 :-
